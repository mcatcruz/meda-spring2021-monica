1st Paragraph: A little bit about myself, my hobby, and why I enjoy doing it.
	My name is Monica Cruz and I discovered watercolor painting in the beginning of the pandemic. I enjoy painting because it is a relaxing activity. It exercises your creativity muscles in many ways: seeing what colors would go together and how to incorporate "mistakes" because there is no undo button to name a few. Lastly, it is satisfying finishing a piece! 

2nd Paragraph: Instructions on how to do your hobby for someone that has never done your hobby.
	To get started, you will need a couple of materials: *unordered list*  
	[TAKE PHOTO OF MATERIALS]
	1. Watercolor paint. There are so many to choose from! The Sennelier Petite Acquerelle Watercolor Paint has a wide range of colors and amazing color payoff.
	2. Two cups for water. These can be of any material. One will be to clean your brushes between colors and the other for starting a new color. This is a perfect way to repurpose old candle jars.
	3. Rags. For wiping your brushes. Essential if you get too much water on the brush.
	4. Paper. Any paper will work, but there are specific paper for watercolor painting available. I recommend Canvas XL (link). This special paper is a heavier weight that prevents the paper from warping. They come in different textures and weights. Also have scratch paper in handy for quick paint swatches before committing the colors to your final piece.
	5. Easel. This is not necessary to start painting, but is nice to have for ergonomics, especially if you are working in larger pieces.
	6. Paintbrushes. These come in different materials, from synthetic to expensive and highly sable hair. They also come in different sizes. I recommend this set (link) as it has good variety of sizes and soft bristles. 
	7. Pencil and eraser. For lightly sketching your idea before painting. This is optional, but highly recommended.

	Now that you are all set up, let's begin painting! *ordered list*
	1. Lightly sketch your idea onto the paper (optional, but highly recommended).  
	2. Dip brush lightly in CLEAN water cup. 
	3. Swipe the brush into color of choice. It is helpful to pick up color by either doing a circular motion with the brush or small rapid swiping motions.
	4. Swatch it on your scratch paper (optional, but highly recommended). This gives you an opportunity to check the color. If you want less pigment, wipe excess onto the rag and/or dip lightly back into the water to dilute the color. If you want more pigment, repeat step 2.
	5. Paint away! Once you are happy with the color on your brush, it's time to swipe the brush onto your work paper. There's really no wrong way to do this. It is best to start with a light hand as you can always add more paint. 
	6. To switch to a new color: dip your brush into the DIRTY water cup. Ensure that the brush is touching the bottom of the cup. Do figure eight motions with your wrist in order rinse out all the color. Dab on to the rag and do a few swatches until no more color remains.
	7. Repeat steps 2 thru 5 with the new color.
