            <h3>Discovering Watercolor</h3>
            <p> I discovered watercolor painting during the pandemic, something to do while sheltering in place. It is a relaxing pastime. I especially enjoy painting still life, flowers, and plants. Painting with watercolor exercises your creativity muscles. You also learn other material and skills along the way. I learned about color theory and troubleshooting when there is no undo button through watercolors. Lastly, it is satisfying finishing a piece, big or small!

            <h3>Materials</h3>
            <p>You do not need to the most expensive, studio-quality items to get started. That being said, it is worth taking the time to research the materials. There are plenty of recommendations online, such as this <a href='https://www.scratchmadejournal.com/blog/watercolor-supplies-for-beginners'>starter kit guide from Scratch Made Journal.</a> See below for a list of suggestions.</p>

                <li><b>Paper.</b> Any unlined paper will work, but there is specific paper for watercolor available. They come in different textures and weights.

                <li><b>Paintbrushes.</b> These come in different materials, from synthetic to the expensive and highly coveted sable hair. They also come in different sizes. The <a href='https://www.amazon.com/RealValue-Golden-Taklon-Brushes-Set/dp/B0061U0X0U/ref=asc_df_B0061U0X0U/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=198100706044&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=9526586030935450011&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9031951&hvtargid=pla-349099909839&psc=1'>Princeton & Co.

                <li><b>Pencil and eraser.</b> For ligthly sketching your idea before painting. This is optional, but highly recommended, especially for intricate work.</li>
                <li><b>Easel.</b> This is not necessary to get your painting journey started, but it is nice to have for ergonomics, especially when working on larger pieces.</li>

            <h3>Let's Begin!</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Lightly sketch your idea onto the paper (optional).</li>
                <li>Dip brush lightly into the <i>clean</i> water cup.</li>
                <li>Swipe the brush into color of choice. It is helpful to pick up color by either doing small circular motions or rapid swiping motions with the brush.</li>
                <li>Swatch it on your scratch paper (optional). This is an opportunity to check the color. For less pigment, wipe excess onto the rag and/or dip the brush lightly into the water to dilute the color. For more pigment, repeat step 2. </li>
                <li>Paint away! Once satisfied with the color on your brush, it's time to swipe the brush onto the work paper. It is best to start with a light hand; you can always add more paint later on.</li>
                <li>To switch to a new color: dip your brush into the <i>dirty</i> water cup. Ensure that the brush is touching the bottom of the cup. Swirl the brush in figure eight motions to thoroughly rinse the bristles. Dab brush on the rag and do a few swatches on scratch paper until no more color remains.</li>
                <li>Repeat steps 2 through 5 with the new color.</li>
            </ol>
