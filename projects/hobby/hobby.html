            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p> I discovered watercolor painting in the beginning of the pandemic. It is a relaxing pastime. I especially enjoy painting still life, flowers, and plants. Painting with watercolor exercises your creativity muscles. You also learn other material and skills along the way. I learned about color theory and troubleshooting when there is no undo button through watercolors. Lastly, it is satisfying finishing a piece, big or small!

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <h4>You will need a few items to get started:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Paint.</b> There are so many to choose from! The <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Sennelier-Petite-Aquarelle-Watercolor-Paint/dp/B01F47044A'>Sennelier Petite Acquerelle Watercolor Paint</a> has a wide range of colors and amazing color payoff. It also comes with a built-in palette for mixing colors.</li>
                <li><b>Paper.</b> Any unlined paper will work, but there is specific paper for watercolor available. They come in different textures and weights. The <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Canson-Heavyweight-Texture-Sizing-Sheets/dp/B00QJVYCQC/ref=asc_df_B00QJVYCQC/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=219561413405&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=7269808428873755481&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9031951&hvtargid=pla-365073854060&psc=1'>Canson XL Mix Media Notebook</a>, for example, is heavier to prevent warping. Also, have scratch paper in handy for quick paint swatches before committing the colors to your final piece.</li>
                <li><b>Paintbrushes.</b> These come in different materials, from synthetic to the expensive and highly coveted sable hair. They also come in different sizes. The <a href='https://www.amazon.com/RealValue-Golden-Taklon-Brushes-Set/dp/B0061U0X0U/ref=asc_df_B0061U0X0U/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=198100706044&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=9526586030935450011&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9031951&hvtargid=pla-349099909839&psc=1'>Princeton & Co. Synthetic Brush Set</a> has a good variety of sizes and soft bristles that helps paint glide smoothly.</li>
                <li><b>Two cups for water.</b> One for cleaning your brushes between colors and the other for starting a new color. This is the perfect time to <a href='https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/how-to-get-wax-out-of-a-candle-jar'>repurpose old candle jars.</a> </li>
                <li><b>Rags.</b> For wiping your brushes. Essential if you get too much water on the brush.</li>
                <li><b>Pencil and eraser.</b> For ligthly sketching your idea before painting. This is optional, but highly recommended, especially for intricate work.</li>
                <li><b>Easel.</b> This is not necessary to get your painting journey started, but it is nice to have for ergonomics, especially when working on larger pieces.</li>

            <h4> Now that you're all set up, let's begin painting!</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Lightly sketch your idea onto the paper (optional).</li>
                <li>Dip brush lightly into <em>clean</em> water cup.</li>
                <li>Swipe the brush into color of choice. It is helpful to pick up color by either doing small circular motions or rapid swiping motions with the brush.</li>
                <li>Swatch it on your scratch paper (optional). This gives you an opportunity to check the color. If you want less pigment, wipe excess onto the rag and/or dip the brush lightly into the water to dilute the color. If you want more pigment, repeat step 2. </li>
                <li>Paint away! Once you are happy with the color on your brush, it's time to swipe the brush onto your work paper. It is best to start with a light hand; you can always add more paint later on.</li>
                <li>To switch to a new color: dip your brush into the <em>dirty</em> water cup. Ensure that the brush is touching the bottom of the cup. Swirl the brush in figure eight motions to thoroughly rinse the bristles. Dab brush on the rag and do a few swatches on your scratch paper until no more color remains.</li>
                <li>Repeat steps 2 through 5 with the new color.</li>
            </ol>
